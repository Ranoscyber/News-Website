    </center>
    <h3>PYONGYANG, Aug. 19 (KCNA):</h3>
    <p> All the people across the DPRK are greeting the 80th anniversary of their country‚Äôs liberation as a great revolutionary auspicious event with great pride and self-confidence as they are dynamically advancing along the road of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliant defence, ushering in a great new era of comprehensive national rejuvenation under the leadership of the ever-victorious Workers‚Äô Party of Korea.

A celebration of the 80th anniversary of Korea‚Äôs liberation took place in Pyongyang on August 14.

The plaza of the Arch of Triumph, which epitomizes the excitement and joy of the people who became the masters of a new Korea and the immortal revolutionary feats and annals of miracles resplendent in the 80-year history of building the country and defending its sovereign rights, was filled with jubilation of the people who are demonstrating the dignity and might of a powerful country, upholding the country‚Äôs strong existence and achieving its steady development with the great revolutionary traditions created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle as a precious wealth.

Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers‚Äô Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, attended the celebration.

When the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un arrived at the venue of the celebration amid the welcome music, fireworks were set off and a lot of balloons flew to beautifully decorate the sky of significant August.

All the participants raised the stormy cheers of ‚ÄúHurrah!‚Äù looking up to the outstanding leader of the Juche revolution who has put their socialist state on the top of the century as the most powerful and dignified country and is dynamically leading the historic cause of realizing the ideals of the people along the road of brilliant victory and glory.

Schoolchildren presented fragrant bouquets to Kim Jong Un reflecting the unanimous desire of the people across the country.

Other schoolchildren presented bouquets to senior officials of the Party, government and armed forces organs and Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation.

Present there were members of the central leadership body of the Party, senior officials of ministries and national agencies, descendants of those related to the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, meritorious persons of socialist patriotism and other officials, working people, youth and students in Pyongyang, service personnel of the Korean People‚Äôs Army, and teaching staff and students of the revolutionary schools.

Present there on invitation were members of the delegation of the State Duma and the delegation of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation who are on a congratulatory visit to the DPRK on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Korea‚Äôs liberation, the Russian ambassador to the DPRK and his embassy members.

Also present there were overseas Korean compatriots staying in their socialist homeland including an expeditionary group of the General Association of Koreans in China for a study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu.

The DPRK national anthem was played solemnly.

A 21-gun salute was fired.

Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK, first vice-president of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People‚Äôs Assembly, made a congratulatory speech.

Noting that today the Korean people are greeting the 80th anniversary of their country‚Äôs liberation, the first precious victory in the glorious history of the Korean revolution spanning a century and an epoch-making event in 5 000 years of their history, the speaker paid immortal glory and highest tribute to President Kim Il Sung who aroused the people, who had been forced to suffer the disgrace and misfortune of a ruined nation, to the anti-Japanese national salvation struggle, put an end to the colonial rule of the

Japanese imperialists, and thus achieved the epochal cause of restoring national sovereignty.

He said that the 40-odd years of struggle of the Korean people for the independence of their country teaches the truth that a country and people without correct leadership and strength cannot escape humiliation as a ruined nation and that the lost dignity can be regained and defended only on the strength of the powerful internal forces of the people themselves rallied closely around a great leader.

Today our state shows the world a new phase of gigantic advance of further promoting the overall national strength under the wise leadership of the great Comrade Kim Jong Un, he said, stressing that as there are the great people, the advantageous political system embodying the people-first principle and the might united with patriotism, the vigorous prosperity of our state will continue and communism desired by the revolutionary forerunners will be built on this land.

Referring to the noble internationalist spirit and distinguished military feats of the service personnel of the Soviet army who fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean revolutionary army for Korea‚Äôs liberation, he said that the unity and comradeship forged at the cost of blood in the struggle for the common cause are fully displayed in the battlefields in the 21st century to frustrate the imperialists‚Äô outrageous arbitrary practices and aggressive moves and are developing into a powerful alliance, which is clear proof of the eternal vitality of the DPRK-Russia friendship.

He continued that the revolutionary forerunners who provided the spiritual legacy that makes people rise up in the face of any difficulties and paved the way for victory are continuously encouraging and pushing us towards an uninterrupted advance, calling upon all the people to continue to wage a dynamic struggle for the eternal prosperity and rejuvenation of the country firmly united with the great ideal of patriotism, our state-first principle.

Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, made a speech.

Saying that he was pleased to attend the grand celebration, he read the congratulatory letter sent to Comrade Kim Jong Un, president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, by Comrade Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, president of the Russian Federation, on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Korea‚Äôs liberation.

Expressing the will to value the Russia-DPRK friendly relations, to thoroughly implement all the provisions of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the Russian Federation and the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, and to strive for the development of the relations between the two countries, he wished the DPRK people prosperity and happiness.

Kim Jong Un made a speech on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of Korea‚Äôs liberation.

Saying that today‚Äôs celebration that makes us recall with deep emotion the birth of our state and the sacred course of its development constitutes an affirmation of the times and a proud review of the immortal spirit that brought about a turn in the people‚Äôs destiny and the history of decades-long resistance as well as of how the 80-year-long history of the new Korea could reach the height of dignity and honour, he made clear the revolutionary character and political importance of the cause of liberation, in which the Korean people regained their dignity as an independent people.

Referring to his boundless reverence for the great people‚Äôs ennobling view of life that they can lead a most worthwhile and happiest life by devoting themselves to the victory and glory of their motherland, he said that no force can bring the people with such a strong sense of justice, great fortitude and high self-respect to their knees, and the state built up and supported by such patriotic and proud people will continue to exist as a powerful country for all ages.

Noting that the Korean people‚Äôs great history of dignity and glory will shine down through the generations, for all eternity, he called for continuing to brave undauntedly the challenges facing us for the building of a great powerful country and for the eternal security and prosperity of our beloved state which will shine its brilliance for ever.

When Kim Jong Un finished his speech, enthusiastic cheers resounded reflecting the firm will of all the participants to remain boundlessly loyal to the historic mission and duty of their era and generation, boundlessly loving and upholding the country which provides them with a genuine life and happiness.

The celebration ended with the playing of The Internationale.

The celebration was of great significance as it fully demonstrated the unshakable faith and will of the Korean people to win without fail the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered in Mt Paektu under the leadership of the great Comrade Kim Jong Un, by giving fuller play to the loyalty, patriotic traditions, indomitable pioneering spirit and heroic stamina with which they have adorned the sacred history of their state with the decades of proud victories and miracles.</p>
