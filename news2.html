    <h2 >Samdech Techo Hun Sen: Cambodia Will Retaliate If Thai Leaders Seek Arrest of Cambodian Leaders</h2>
    </center>
    <h3>(Phnom Penh):</h3>
    <p> 
Samdech Techo Hun Sen posted a message stating that If Thailand is in a position to arrest Cambodian leaders, then Cambodia could likewise arrest certain Thai leaders who have invaded and killed Cambodian citizens.
</p>
<p>Samdech Techo wrote on his social media on Monday night (Aug. 18) as follows:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAccording to a recent report by a Thai newspaper, the acting Prime Minister of Thailand stated that Hun Sen and Hun Manet would be immediately arrested if found in Thailand.</p>
<p>If the newspaper‚Äôs publication accurately reflects the acting Prime Minister‚Äôs remarks, who is nearing the end of his term, it reveals that he is a reckless individual who lacks understanding of customary law and diplomatic protocol.</p>
<p>If Thailand is in a position to arrest Cambodian leaders, then Cambodia could likewise arrest certain Thai leaders who have invaded and killed Cambodian citizens.</p>
<p>Customary law has been violated by the aggressors.

Is this an effort to build trust and move toward better relations, or an act of provocation that could reignite conflict following the ceasefire agreement?‚Äù</p>
