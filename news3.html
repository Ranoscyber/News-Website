    <h3>On August 15, 2025</h3>
    <p> U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, marking their first in-person meeting since the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The summit concluded without concrete agreements, though both leaders described it as useful and timely.Trump later suggested that Ukraine might need to cede territory to achieve peace, a stance that drew criticism from both domestic and international observers .Following the Alaska summit, Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington, D.C., on August 18. During this meeting, Trump announced plans to facilitate direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin, aiming to resolve the ongoing conflict. European leaders expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine and a commitment to territorial integrity In the aftermath of these diplomatic efforts, Russia launched a significant missile and drone attack on Ukraine, marking the largest such assault in August. The strike targeted energy infrastructure, leading to widespread fires and raising concerns about Russia's commitment to peace negotiations As of now, discussions continue regarding the potential location for the proposed Zelenskyy-Putin summit, with Geneva being suggested as a neutral venue. The international community remains watchful, awaiting concrete steps toward a lasting resolution to the conflict</p>
