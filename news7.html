    <h2 >Fantasy football rankings 2025: Top sleepers by model that nailed James Cook's dominant season</h2>
    </center>
    <h3>On August 17, 2025</h3>
    <p>When football fans think of the AFC West and AFC East, the Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills jump out above the rest with their divisional dominance. However, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers may have one of the most underappreciated divisional championship reigns in recent history as the Bucs have won four straight NFC South titles, yet they don't garner the same respect as other consistent winners. Fantasy football players should be aware of Tampa Bay though, with Baker Mayfield coming off a QB4 season with Bucky Irving at RB13 and Mike Evans as WR14 for the No. 4 scoring team in the NFL.Where should these Tampa Bay options fall in 2025 Fantasy football rankings? With Chris Godwin still recovering from a season-ending ankle injury, could Tampa Bay produce 2025 Fantasy football sleepers at receiver with young pass-catchers like Jalen McMillan or Emeka Egbuka? Before crafting your 2025 Fantasy football draft strategy, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy football rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills running back James Cook would comfortably outperform his ADP (RB14). The result: Cook rushed for 1,009 yards and 16 touchdowns while adding 32 receptions for 258 yards and two more scores as a receiver. He finished as RB8 in CBS Sports PPR leagues and his maturation into a scoring threat cemented his status as a Fantasy football superstar.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, identifying A.J. Brown as a sleeper in 2020, nailing Jonathan Taylor's monstrous season in 2021 and correctly predicting C.J. Stroud would take a step back in 2024. Additionally, it's called past Fantasy football sleepers like Derrick Henry in 2019, Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara in 2018, and Davante Adams in 2017. Anybody who banked on players like those made a run at their league title.
